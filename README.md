//INSERT TITLE

Welcome the Patch 6.12, the ARAM patch. While there are a decent amount of non-Howling-Abyss changes here, we figured we'd take this opportunity to speak directly to the poro-lovers of Murder Bridge.

We don’t often make straight adjustments to ARAM as a mode, so let’s slap some context on that. While we don’t plan to ever fully balance a random mode given the obscure (and sometimes soul-crushing) compositions it can churn out, we’re confident we can make some pretty big wins by easing some of the more obvious outliers. That means addressing the dominance of healers and poke teams, as well as giving melee champions (and gold-starved classes of all shapes and sizes) a better shot at equal footing. You can read more on the changes below, but all-random players: Snowdown’s come early.

For those that prefer their maps a little less frozen, we’ve still got changes you can sink your teeth into. Much of this patch is focused on light tweaks (especially on the items and mastery side) to nudge certain classes and builds upwards or downwards in the hopes of letting those stuck in the middle shine through. Slap on some extra scalings here and there (and a whole 6 seconds off Corki’s rank 1 dash) and you’ll see that, ARAM or otherwise, this patch is all about the little guys.

And that’s all for us! Until next time - may all your Marks lead to Dashes, and your Dashes lead to sweet, sweet victory.

GOD OF WAR (PS4) PREVIEW

Source the verge

Sony started its annual E3 press conference this evening with a gameplay demo of a new God of War game. The footage shows the franchise's main antihero, Kratos, training a young boy to hunt in the wilderness. The boy, who calls Kratos his father, helps him take down a series of vicious monsters, showing off the series' signature mix of hack-and-slash action and quick-time event cutscenes. There does appear to be a more fluid, Dark Souls-style combat going on though. Kratos also has a wicked beard, so there's that, too.

The title does not appear to be an official God of War 4, but rather a reboot of the franchise, a direct sequel, or possibly a prequel to the main series, in which Kratos is still a mortal man and a father before becoming beholden to Ares. It also isn't clear that this new God of War is set in a time before or after Ancient Greece, or if it's going to tackle an entirely new mythology like the much rumored Norse setting. Kratos still has his ash-white skin, after all. But he's also wielding an axe and not his signature Blades of Chaos. So many questions, so little information! One thing we know for sure: Kratos is back.
