# Test
Darnel and Nhan's test 
Welcome the Patch 6.12, the ARAM patch. While there are a decent amount of non-Howling-Abyss changes here, we figured we'd take this opportunity to speak directly to the poro-lovers of Murder Bridge.

We don’t often make straight adjustments to ARAM as a mode, so let’s slap some context on that. While we don’t plan to ever fully balance a random mode given the obscure (and sometimes soul-crushing) compositions it can churn out, we’re confident we can make some pretty big wins by easing some of the more obvious outliers. That means addressing the dominance of healers and poke teams, as well as giving melee champions (and gold-starved classes of all shapes and sizes) a better shot at equal footing. You can read more on the changes below, but all-random players: Snowdown’s come early.

For those that prefer their maps a little less frozen, we’ve still got changes you can sink your teeth into. Much of this patch is focused on light tweaks (especially on the items and mastery side) to nudge certain classes and builds upwards or downwards in the hopes of letting those stuck in the middle shine through. Slap on some extra scalings here and there (and a whole 6 seconds off Corki’s rank 1 dash) and you’ll see that, ARAM or otherwise, this patch is all about the little guys.

And that’s all for us! Until next time - may all your Marks lead to Dashes, and your Dashes lead to sweet, sweet victory.
